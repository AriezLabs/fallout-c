# Fallout C

This is so far just a braindump of stuff that I might want the game to be/have.

## Gameplay

* Top down 2D world
* 3D like characters and maybe even elements
* Crafting system for weapons
* Huge/ridiculous weapons, but not arcade-y
* Survival mechanics, outback fucks you up
* Player can set up camp anywhere
* Mad Max style vehicles, but electric with nuclear battery and extremely rare.
    * Guns retrofitted to vehicles
    * A vehicle with an actual nuke
    * Camper vehicles
    * A fortress on wheels: weaponized road train
    * Sick sounds: turbine sound from generator + varying number of electric motors + drivetrain
* Algorithm that adapts map after explosions of any size - or script this?
* Animals are ridiculously huge (think 2 meters large spiders)

## Story

* Set in Australia
* Player can venture into Outback and some city
* Aboriginal ghouls have formed a huge city inside that huge rock
* Tiny settlements in the desert were unaffected by the bombs
* These have developed into larger, specialized cities now - factions
* One of them was too tiny and is just a bunch of inbred people
